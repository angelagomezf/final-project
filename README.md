# Wine not?
## Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project
---
The **main goal** of this final project is to put into practice the knowledge acquired through the 9-week in a bootcamp in a topic of our choice. 

### Choosing a topic
After watching [Disrupting Wine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12645184/) (a documentary about the the founder of Vivino) I became very interested and curious about wines. Which is why I decided to dive deeper into this industry for my final project, because **wine not**?

My first idea was to make a comparison between Vivino's reviews (which are given by users who might or might not be experts in the field) and between renowned sommelier's.



### Dataset
I sourced the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

1. nailing down the topic --> documentary, wine lover, curious, not an expert
2. finding good datasets --> kaggle, google toolbox, european commision
3.
